# TimeTamer – Smart Daily Scheduling with Dependencies and Constraints

This project builds a smart scheduler that generates a personalized, conflict-free daily plan based on task duration, time constraints, dependencies, and physical location, and all tailored to a real-world academic lifestyle.

The scheduler uses structured logic to prioritize tasks, account for prerequisites, and ensure no overlap, which is a practical application of algorithmic thinking to real-life chaos.

## Problem Overview

Given a set of tasks (each with a description, duration, status, and dependencies), your goal is to create a working day schedule that:

- Honors required task orders (via prerequisites)
- Adheres to fixed-time constraints (e.g. 8:00 class)
- Avoids time overlaps and manages parallel tasks
- Optionally considers locations to minimize transition delays

---

## Features

- Dependency-aware scheduling
- Prioritized task ordering based on available time and duration
- Time constraint parsing (fixed vs flexible)
- Location logic included for future travel-time support
- Clean task schema for extensibility

## Why This Project?

Because real life doesn’t fit into neat calendar blocks. This project tackles what Google Calendar doesn’t: flexible tasks, dependencies, and optimization when you have more to do than hours in a day.

It demonstrates how algorithms, data structuring, and realistic constraints can work together to solve planning problems that actually matter.
